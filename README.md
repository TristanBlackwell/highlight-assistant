# Highlight Assistant

An exploration into using an LLM as an _assistant_ for the comprehension of text.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js v24](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

### Steps

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`.
2. Run the application: `npm run dev`
3. View the application on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Usage

When viewing the application you will see an excerpt from David Deutsch's [The Beginning of Infinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beginning_of_Infinity). Read this text and gain an understanding. Given that this is just a tiny subset of a much larger topic, and that the [concepts can be hard to grok](https://stephenwhitt.wordpress.com/2011/12/03/the-beginning-of-infinity-chapter-eight/), it is natural you may have questions around the text which would aid comprehension.

### Highlight mode

You can enter _highlight mode_ by pressing the `h` key, or using the floating button in the bottom left of the page. This mode exposes new behaviours when highlighting text.
